Our http://gameful.org/ game jam game. RSS news feeds are reformatted as injectable JSON using a Yahoo Pipe, loaded from the browser, and then primitive sentiment analysis is performed to judge each headline to be 'good' or 'bad'. You, as a helpful monster, must eat the 'bad' headlines before they reach the child. 

However, the child needs some 'good' headlines to educate himself and grow.

Credits are Rob for the graphics and game engine, Tali for the rather simple newsfeed loading and sentiment analysis.
